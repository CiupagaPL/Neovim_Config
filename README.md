# Neovim Config

## General Info

I created this repository because rewriting the configuration for Neovim from scratch is not easy.
I also once thought about sharing my general Linux configuration, but at the moment, this is not very feasible because I switched to KDE Plasma.
In it, I use Vim-Plug as the plugin manager, which you can find [here](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).
You can always get inspired by this configuration and use it in your projects.

## Have a Good One!
